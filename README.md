https://fullstackopen.com assignments of parts 1-13, 2023<br />
I am using these exercices to learn and test some stuff, so the exercices might not match 100% to task's description or be 100% correct.<br />
"Osa 4" has code improvements, that could fix few mistakes from earlier parts of the course (osa1-osa3).<br />
So my programming knowledge and skills have gone up by a notch.
